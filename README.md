# 8 Puzzle problem
this is a small aplication that has 8 puzzle and can solve it using diffrent algorithms

## This Application can solve this puzzle with this algorithms
- BFS (Breath First Search)
- DLS (Depth Limited Search)
- IDDFS (Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search)
- Bidirectional BFS (Bidirectional Breadth-First Search)
- A* (A-star Search)
- GBFS (Greedy Best-First Search)

## Set your custom state as goal (Optional)

you can customize the goal state for the algorithm by clicking on the target buttons
until the desired configuration is reached, then click 'Set this config'

you can randomize the current state with the "Random Move" button in the top panel

you can change the algorithm by selecting the algorithm in the bottom panel and click solve
you can also set the auto solve option on or off
